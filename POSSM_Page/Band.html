        <p class="bio-text">Earl is a high school Health and PE teacher who for some reason decided it was a good idea to learn how to play guitar
        and then sing in front of people. Having no social awareness he then formed a band and made his friends and family
        pretend to be fans. Earl is having a blast being a part of POSSM, surfing whenever possible and hanging out with his
        wife Jane and 6 year-old daughter Lillian. He is the oldest member of the band… but just barely.</p>

        <p class="bio-text">Jeremy is the youngest member of the POSSM. A former high school student of Earl’s, he spends most of his free time
        swiping right on Tinder and driving from Mansfield to play shows in Hartford. Jeremy is POSSM’s Bass and sometimes lead
        guitar player and reels in the cougars with his sexy riffs and sweet sweet vocals. Jer has earned his masters in Spanish
        from ECSU and recently returned from a sabbatical living and working in Central America to immerse himself in the
        langauge and culture.
        <br>
        <br>
        When he is not playing with the POSSM Jer tours around the state doing solo performances of covers and his original music. Check out his pages below!</p>

        <p class="bio-text">Ben earned his graduate degree from The Hartt School of Music in composition and holds a degree in percussion which
        makes him wildly underqualified to hold any job in the real world and wildly overqualified to play in POSSM. Ben moved
        to Connecticut from Colorado and has since grown a fantastic mustache. Ben has fallen in love with the Hartford
        community and appreciates the opportunity play fun music with guys that are almost as handsome as he is.
